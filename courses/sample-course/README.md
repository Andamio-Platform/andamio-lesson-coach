# Sample Course

This is a placeholder directory structure for testing lesson generation.

## Structure

```
sample-course/
  modules/
    [module-name]/
      lessons/
        [lesson-file].md
```

## Usage

When testing the MCP server's lesson generation:

1. Generated lessons can be saved here to test the full course structure
2. Use this to verify that lessons integrate properly within a course/module hierarchy
3. Keep this as a reference for the expected directory organization

## Note

Real courses should be created in their own directories under `/courses/` with descriptive names (e.g., `/courses/cardano-developer-course/`).
