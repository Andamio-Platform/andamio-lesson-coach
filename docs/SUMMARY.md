## Key Decisions Needed

### Decision 1: Licensing
- [ ] MIT (open source) ⭐ Recommended
- [ ] AGPL + Commercial (dual license)
- [ ] Source-available (BSL)
- [ ] Proprietary

**Recommendation**: Start MIT, can change if needed

---

### Decision 2: Branding
- [ ] "Andamio Lesson Coach" (tied to Andamio brand) ⭐
- [ ] Separate brand (e.g., "ContributeEdu Coach")

**Recommendation**: Keep Andamio brand for ecosystem value

---

### Decision 3: Free Tier Generosity
- [ ] 10 lessons/month (tight, pushes to paid)
- [ ] 25 lessons/month (generous, builds adoption) ⭐
- [ ] Unlimited free (very generous, hard to monetize)

**Recommendation**: 25/month - generous enough to be useful, limited enough to create Pro tier value

---

### Decision 4: Platform Users
- [ ] Pay like everyone else
- [ ] Get discount (e.g., 50% off Pro)
- [ ] Get Pro features free ⭐

**Recommendation**: Pro features free for Andamio Platform users (incentivizes platform adoption)

---

## What Makes This Unique

### Product Differentiators
1. **Contribution-Centered Pedagogy** - Not just content generation
2. **MCP Integration** - Works with Claude, not standalone
3. **Specialized Lesson Types** - Not generic templates

## Questions to Consider

1. **Time**: How much time can you invest in this as a product (vs. internal tool)?
2. **Revenue**: Is revenue a priority or nice-to-have?
3. **Brand**: Should this build Andamio brand or be separate?
4. **Team**: Will you hire for this or keep it lean?
5. **Integration**: When to integrate into Andamio Platform?

**Recommended Answers for Andamio Context**:
1. 10-20 hours/week (significant but not full-time)
2. Revenue is nice-to-have, but adoption + brand building matter more
3. Build Andamio brand (ecosystem play)
4. Keep lean for first 6 months, hire part-time support after revenue
5. Integrate by Month 3-4 (after initial validation)
